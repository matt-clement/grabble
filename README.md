# Grabble
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matt-clement/grabble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matt-clement/grabble)

Hello, and welcome to the Grabble git repository!

Grabble is a small personal project of mine to create an implementation of a graph in ruby. My initial motivation for doing this was to store a large quantity of words and be able to easily query for words that are similar (e.g. off by n letters).

Please note that this is not the most performant code at the moment, and everything is stored in memory (which is why I named the main class `Cache`)

I'll write up more detailed instructions after a little bit more development.

#Todo list:
- Tests
- Docs
- Cleanup
